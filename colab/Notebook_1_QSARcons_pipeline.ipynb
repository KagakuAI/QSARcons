    "### Introduction to QSARcons\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**  \n",
    "``QSARcons`` is a package designed to identify the optimal consensus of Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationship (QSAR) models. It leverages various chemical descriptors and machine learning methods to combine multiple QSAR models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview:**  \n",
    "QSARcons offers three primary consensus search strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Random search**: explores random combinations of QSAR models of size N.  \n",
    "- **Systematic search**: all models are sorted by accuracy metric on the validation set, and the top N models are selected.  \n",
    "- **Genetic search**: Utilizes genetic algorithms to evolve and select the best-performing model combinations of size N."
